# HangmanGame


In this project, you will use Mininet to emulate a network topology consisting of one server and three client nodes and implement a multi-player Hangman game application on top of this topology using a client-server model. Clients run client codes to make use of the capabilities they are provided with and server is responsible for authenticating users, receive player actions form users and apply and display them for the proper intended users. 

Next, you will write your server and client codes. You can also use simple telnet for clients if you can make it work. Note that NOTHING is stored on the client side. The server takes care of everything. For every functionality required by and available for client, you should modify the server program to support that.
It is recommended that you use localhost when writing your codes for ease of debugging, and after completing them, take it into the Mininet emulated network, run it and prepare it for the demo.
